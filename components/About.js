              How does this work? Do you send email to verify the email address?
            </Text>
            <Text style={styles.subheading}>
              No email is actually sent for the email verification. We use 5
              step process for the email verification - Email format and syntax,
              Valid Domain, Temporary or disposable email inboxes, MX Records
              checkup, SMTP authentication. This process provides maximum
              accuracy of email validation.

              What is the output of email list cleaning? What does the statuses
              mean?
            </Text>
            <Text style={styles.subheading}>
              a. Valid - The email is 100% deliverable, safe to send and can be
              used for the marketing or sales purposes.
              {'\n'}
              b. Invalid - The email address can be part of disposable
              mailboxes, incorrect syntax or MX records donâ€™t exist.
              {'\n'}
              c. Risky - Domain is not reachable for the email address and is
              risky to send the email.
              {'\n'}
              d. Unknown - In case the email type is accept-all or firewall
              block the SMTP authentication. These email addresses are
              approximately 80% accurate.
